# Meat Juggler

This game was submitted for the 2022 Gamedev.js game jam. 
It is playable here: https://juanlrodriguesz.itch.io/meat-juggler

This was entirely programmed in Javascript using the Pixi.js and Howler.js APIs. 

I Programmed the game in full, and composed the music for it, while Juan Rodriguez took care of the art, and we both designed the game.

It was my first jam, and I am looking forward to participating in more jams, where I will post more source code here.
